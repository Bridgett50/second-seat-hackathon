# Final repair acceptance

Muse Code authored 127 commits on this history, the most of any one name, not every commit. Bridgett Sanders and Bridgett50 authored 142. The repair stack (FR1–FR10) was done by Cursor Agent (51 commits). Grok Bot authored 10. Grok and Codex reviewed. This ledger was written by the Cursor cloud agent. Reviewed target `005201ef83c2c94b110a643b6f89606928d3d349`. Platform for every local command below is Linux. GitHub CI is listed separately and is not treated as a local run. This run's token usage was not reported by the environment. No zero-cost claim is made.

Not recording-ready. FR1–FR3 are fixed and the offline script matches the executed synthetic flow, but the Windows citation and clipboard checks are UNVERIFIED.

## Acceptance

| ID | Type | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR1-1 | RED | PASS | Parent `005201e` dispatched once (`sent.calls` 1, expected 0). Head `9cd25bf` blocks with 0 calls. Local web test. |
| FR1-2 | RED | PASS | Same parent failure and head block, after preview invalidation. |
| FR1-3 | RED | PASS | Same parent failure and head block for restored `123456`. |
| FR1-4 | CONTROL | PASS | Direct verifier: restored address blocks, mask passes. Passed on the parent and the head. |
| FR1-5 | CONTROL | PASS | One dispatch of the masked correction. Passed on the parent and the head. |
| FR1-6 | CONTROL | PASS | A new transcript does not keep the old address. Passed on the parent and the head. |
| FR1-7 | CONTROL | PASS | A late redaction cannot restore the older spans. Passed on the parent and the head. |
| FR1-8 | CONTROL | PASS | Preview invalidation clears approval, findings, and copy. Passed on the parent and the head. |
| FR2-1 | RED | PASS | Parent payload stayed `prepared` after `provider_confirmed`. Head `481cced` is `dispatched`. |
| FR2-2 | RED | PASS | Same parent payload failure when claims block. Head keeps `dispatched` and a null result. |
| FR2-3 | CONTROL | PASS | No receipt before the callback. Passed on the parent and the head. |
| FR2-4 | CONTROL | PASS | Mid-flight `invoked` passed on the parent. The final dispatched-after-rejection check failed on the parent for the same reason as FR2-1 and passes on the head. |
| FR2-5 | CONTROL | PASS | `http_error` and `transport_failed` stay distinct. Payload is `failed`. Passed on the parent and the head. |
| FR2-6 | CONTROL | PASS | Revoke before the callback: 0 calls. Passed on the parent and the head. |
| FR2-7 | CONTROL | PASS | No second callback after revoke. The 503 receipt remains. Passed on the parent and the head. |
| FR2-8 | CONTROL | PASS | Older analysis does not replace the newer result. The first draft of this test was invalid and was corrected before the head run. |
| FR3-1 | RED | PASS | Parent status was `verified` with claims `not_run`. Head `0366842` is `structural`. |
| FR3-2 | RED | PASS | Parent title was `Verified` for an empty brief. Head is not. |
| FR3-3 | RED | PASS | Parent redaction-only status was `verified`. Head title is `Redaction check passed`. |
| FR3-4 | CONTROL | PASS | Supported verdict may still say `Verified`. Passed on the parent and the head. |
| FR3-5 | CONTROL | PASS | Hard claim failures still block and do not leak the qualifier. Passed on the parent and the head. |
| FR3-6 | RED | PASS | Parent warning omitted "Claim support not checked." Head includes it. |
| FR3-7 | RED | PASS | Offline HTTP session completed and the state API status was `verified` on the parent. Head agrees with the DOM that claims were not run. An earlier attempt that omitted `expectedRevision` is not this evidence. |
| FR4-1 | RED | PASS | Parent CRLF parse returned `[]`. Head `aa7d0af` matches the LF parse. |
| FR4-2 | CONTROL | PASS | LF lines, blanks, a malformed line, and no trailing newline. Passed on the parent. |
| FR4-3 | RED | PASS | Parent rendered no segments, so citations had no target. Head resolves them. |
| FR4-4 | RED | PASS | Parent CRLF table row gained an empty cell. Head matches the LF row, five cells. |
| FR4-5 | ENV | UNVERIFIED | Native Windows browser citation tests were not run. |
| FR5-1 | ENV | UNVERIFIED | Native Windows report CLIs were not run. |
| FR5-2 | ENV | UNVERIFIED | Native Windows Vitest workers were not run. |
| FR5-3 | CONTROL | PASS | File URL import of a path with a space and `#` returned 7 and ran once. Linux head `88b7664`. |
| FR5-4 | CONTROL | PASS | Four forbidden spellings are refused by the guard predicates. Held-out wrappers exit 2 with no dataset read. No sealed file was opened. |
| FR5-5 | CONTROL | PASS | Dev reports exit 0. A child with the guard file URL has `__sealedGuardInstalled`. |
| FR6-1 | CONTROL | PASS | Linux boundary A only, on head `401dc74`: `writeText` argument equals the approved draft, including LF. Native readback was not asserted on that head. |
| FR6-2 | ENV | UNVERIFIED | Windows native clipboard readback was not run. The LF-to-CRLF allowance was not exercised. |
| FR6-3 | CONTROL | PASS | Comparator rejects word, line, space, punctuation, and bare-CR changes. This is not a native clipboard. |
| FR6-4 | CONTROL | PASS | Zero `writeText` calls until a fresh approval. |
| FR7-1 | RED | PASS | Parent report said a mutated checker missed rows. Head `c3b9894` says analytical baseline. |
| FR7-2 | CONTROL | PASS | Pattern 14/14, spark 14/14, shield 14/14, gate 11/11, false alarms 0/16. Zero reference stays separate. |
| FR7-3 | CONTROL | PASS | `node eval/shield-report.mjs --split dev` exit 0. Held-out wrapper still exits 2. No model call. |
| FR8-1 | DOC | DOCUMENTED | "scrub all the sensitive data" replaced with supported-category masking, owner review, and no universal guarantee. September 7 story kept. |
| FR8-2 | DOC | DOCUMENTED | Market paragraph is her requirement. Temperature 0 is not an identical-output proof. |
| FR8-3 | DOC | DOCUMENTED | Payload note no longer promises real-upload pre-storage masking. |
| FR8-4 | DOC | DOCUMENTED | Web default 240s, client/batch 90s, override named. |
| FR8-5 | DOC | DOCUMENTED | Four attempts total. Counter is accounted completions. Not a Modal cap. |
| FR8-6 | CONTROL | PASS | Missing live config throws. Test mode stays offline. No provider call. |
| FR8-7 | DOC | DOCUMENTED | Table says the check is after the preview and before dispatch. |
| FR8-7 | CONTROL | PASS | Preview is shown. Restored address does not dispatch. |
| FR8-8 | DOC | DOCUMENTED | "exactly one send per approval" removed. |
| FR8-8 | CONTROL | PASS | One token, two guarded callbacks, two `provider_confirmed` receipts. |
| FR8-9 | DOC | DOCUMENTED | "10/10 brief entries across three development meetings." PR count is 65 at the reviewed snapshot, not a living metric. |
| FR8-10 | DOC | DOCUMENTED | Offline full date `March 4, 2027` is still a DOB mask. November 15 without a year still stands. |
| FR8-10 | CONTROL | PASS | `MockRedactor` on that sentence. Redactor source not edited. |
| FR8-11 | DOC | DOCUMENTED | #116 and target rehearsals are owner-attested. A run summary is not a video. Video URL and tryouts stay pending. |
| FR8-12 | DOC | DOCUMENTED | Engineering-log links use `codex/cursor-D-review.md`. Video links use `../../apps/...`. |
| FR8-13 | DOC | DOCUMENTED | Reload text that tests require stays as the historical baseline. #73 is not called merged. |
| FR8-14 | DOC | DOCUMENTED | Demo Mode is presentation only. Sealed runners are not authorized and were not run. |
| FR8-15 | DOC | DOCUMENTED | Three test titles renamed. Assertions not loosened. |
| FR9-1 | CONTROL | PASS | Linux Chromium, `e2e/fr9-synthetic.spec.ts`. Offline label and Demo Mode. Phone and names masked. Email remains. |
| FR9-2 | CONTROL | PASS | Same spec. Email and phone are absent from analyzer calls before the correction. |
| FR9-3 | CONTROL | PASS | Same spec. One analyzer call with the corrected text. Two entries. Zero pressure items. Claims `not_run`. Heading is "Needs owner review" because a line escalates. |
| FR9-4 | CONTROL | PASS | Same spec. Each citation href matches one element. |
| FR9-5 | CONTROL | PASS | Same spec, boundary A: `writeText` equals the approved draft once. Boundary B was not asserted on head `5d4c13e`. |
| FR9-6 | CONTROL | PASS | Same spec. Editing the draft disables Copy. |
| FR9-7 | DOC | DOCUMENTED | Scripts no longer tell the offline take to show "last chance" or to mask a phone that is already masked. |
| FR9-8 | DOC | DOCUMENTED | Proof note `docs/release/fr9-offline-rehearsal.md`. No required `[seg-2]`. Take remains within 3:00. No video URL invented. |
| FR10-1 | CONTROL | PASS | This table. |
| FR10-2 | CONTROL | PASS | Local commands listed under each PR. GitHub `ci / build-and-test` succeeded for #120, #122, #121, #123, and #124. Later PRs were still running when this ledger was written. |
| FR10-3 | CONTROL | PASS | `git diff --name-only 005201e HEAD` has no `config/live`, `redact.ts`, `muse.ts`, `glimmer_app.py`, prompt, schema, or redaction-eval scorer path. |
| FR10-4 | CONTROL | PASS | Public pin file `config/live/glimmer-launch-config.json` still has prompt `287f1971…d1b5`, schema `fa3842b7…08ac`, scorer `ba0a0756…6481`. That file is not in the repair diff. Hashes were not recomputed from source in this step, and no sealed checksum was run. |
| FR10-5 | CONTROL | PASS | Dev shield report on the FR7 head, analytical baseline labeled. No secret values printed. |
| FR10-6 | ENV | UNVERIFIED | Final browser run on Bridgett's Windows machine was not executed. Both clipboard boundaries are UNVERIFIED there. |
| FR10-7 | DOC | DOCUMENTED | Disposition table below. |

## Clipboard boundaries

Executed on Linux Chromium after the ledger's first draft, in `e2e/fr6-clipboard.spec.ts` and `e2e/fr9-synthetic.spec.ts`. Both commands exited 0 (3 tests).

| Boundary | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| A. Argument passed to `navigator.clipboard.writeText` | PASS. Byte-exact match to the approved draft, including LF. FR6 draft `First synthetic line.\nSecond synthetic line.`. FR9 draft `Please send a corrected written quote. I have not accepted the deadline.` | UNVERIFIED. The spy was not run on Windows. |
| B. Native OS clipboard readback | PASS on this Linux Chromium. `readText()` equaled the approved draft, including LF. No newline conversion occurred. | UNVERIFIED. The only allowed difference, LF to CRLF, was not observed because the native Windows clipboard was not read. |

## RED assertion messages

A failure counts only when the named assertion ran on the parent and failed. These are those messages.

- FR1-1, FR1-2, FR1-3: `expect(sent.calls).toBe(0)` received `1`.
- FR2-1, FR2-2: `expect(after.payload?.status).toBe("dispatched")` received `"prepared"`.
- FR3-1: `expect(view.status).not.toBe("verified")` received `"verified"`.
- FR3-2: `expect(view.title).not.toBe("Verified")` received `"Verified"`.
- FR3-3: `expect(view.status).not.toBe("verified")` received `"verified"`.
- FR3-6: warning message did not contain `"Claim support not checked."`.
- FR3-7: `expect(state.verification.status).not.toBe("verified")` received `"verified"`, with state `completed`. An earlier run that stopped at `expectedRevision` never reached this assertion and is not RED evidence.
- FR4-1: `expect(parsed).toEqual(ids(LF))` received `[]`.
- FR4-3: `expect(segments.length).toBeGreaterThan(0)` received `0`.
- FR4-4: `expect(fromLf).toEqual(fromCrlf)` failed because the CRLF row ended with an extra `""`.
- FR7-1: `expect(result.report).toMatch(/analytical baseline \(all layers off\)/)` failed. The received report said a mutated checker missed seeded rows.

## R1–R16

| Finding | Disposition |
|---|---|
| R1 span evidence cleared | Fixed in #120. End-to-end coverage in #125. |
| R2 Windows parsing, import, and clipboard | Parsing fixed in #123. Import URLs fixed in #124. Clipboard contract tested on Linux in #127. Windows execution UNVERIFIED. |
| R3 false prepared status | Fixed in #122. |
| R4 unqualified Verified | Fixed in #121. Wording follows in #126. |
| R5 universal privacy and competitor claims | Documented in #126. Founder story kept. |
| R6 deterministic-output guarantee | Documented in #126. |
| R7 transcript and script mismatch | Script matched to the executed offline flow in #125. |
| R8 real-upload promise | Documented in #126. |
| R9 hard-coded mutation result | Relabeled in #128 as an analytical baseline (all layers off). `eval/shield-report.mjs` still hard-codes `mutantCaught = 0`. That is not a measured fix. The rules 0/13 gap was not edited. |
| R10 timeout, retry, accounting, startup prose | Documented in #126. Frozen runtime unchanged. |
| R11 verification timing | Documented in #126, with a session control. |
| R12 chronology, reload, video status | Documented in #126 and #125. Owner-attested, not independently verified. |
| R13 broken relative links | Documented in #126. |
| R14 denominator and PR count | Documented in #126. 10/10 entries across three meetings. 65 at the reviewed snapshot. |
| R15 offline full-date overmask | Documented limitation in #126. `redact.ts` not edited. |
| R16 one send per approval | Documented in #126. Token is not consumed. |
| Unauthenticated Modal endpoint | Still disclosed. No engine change authorized. |
| Residual-PII evasions and semantic 0/13 gap | Still disclosed. No engine change authorized. |
| Sealed-runner exception | Runners exist, were not run, and are not authorized. |

## Blocked

1. A new live or paid rehearsal, Modal or Baseten deploy, warmup, or GPU job.
2. A sealed holdout run, including reading `eval/heldout/`, `services/bot/fixtures/holdout-v1/`, or the sealed checksum files.
3. Any edit to frozen prompts, schemas, `config/live/**` including its README, `redact.ts`, `muse.ts`, `glimmer_app.py`, or the redaction scorer inputs.
4. Endpoint authentication that would require a frozen engine change.
5. Recording the founder clip, filling user observations, or posting the X draft.
6. Declaring the Windows recording machine ready before its citation and clipboard checks pass.

## Windows handoff

On the machine Bridgett will record from, check out `cursor/fr9-synthetic-rehearsal-ec4c` at `5d4c13ee372a9b0d144ce6fdadb2a61c66affae3` or a descendant that contains these commits. Then:

1. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
2. `pnpm --filter @second-seat/core build`
3. `pnpm --filter @second-seat/web exec playwright install chromium`
4. `pnpm --filter @second-seat/web exec playwright test e2e/hero.spec.ts e2e/g6-rehearsal.spec.ts e2e/fr6-clipboard.spec.ts e2e/fr9-synthetic.spec.ts`
5. Record the two clipboard boundaries separately. Boundary A is the string passed to `writeText`. Boundary B is the native Windows readback. The only allowed difference on B is LF becoming CRLF. Any boundary that does not run stays UNVERIFIED. A killed runner is not a pass.
5. `node eval/shield-report.mjs --split dev` and `node eval/resistance-table.mjs --split dev` with no compatibility loader.
6. Record pass and fail counts and the process exit code. A killed runner is not a pass. Do not call Linux results a Windows pass.
