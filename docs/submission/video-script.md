# Demo script (offline engineering proof of one pasted meeting) — target 2:45, max 3:00

This plan is an offline take labeled Offline demo. It is a safe fallback, not a decision that the submission must be offline-only. A future live clip is optional and would replace time inside this plan. It is not authorized and not recorded here.

Timecodes include speech at about 150 words per minute plus clicks, corrections, waiting, and short pauses. The timing table is an unspoken note at the end.

Founder story: done — supplied in the README founder section. User observations: PENDING — not yet supplied. Video URLs: PENDING — not yet supplied. Windows citation and clipboard checks: PENDING. Record nothing for the pending slots until they are supplied; invent no quotes, anecdotes, or URLs.

## Opening line (founder-supplied, spoken verbatim)

> "Just last month, on September 7, a vendor and I agreed on seven hundred dollars a month for point-of-sale hardware. The written quote said seven hundred fifty. I caught the difference and he corrected it. I built Second Seat for myself first. The idea predates this hackathon. This week's build is the live engine."

The whole video follows ONE meeting through the connected `/session` flow: paste the unchanged `demo/synthetic-transcript.txt`, look at the local mock, show the blocked Analyze, correct by hand, approve, analyze, click a citation that is on the page, type a draft, approve that exact text, copy once, and edit a word so Copy turns off. No screenshot upload. No SAM. No timed replay.

| Time | On screen | Bridgett says |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00–0:25 | Bridgett on camera. Disclosure card visible: "Pre-existing: the Second Seat idea and an earlier prototype in a separate repo. Built this week (Oct 26–Nov 4): everything in this repo." Story card: on September 7 a vendor agreed $700 a month; the written quote said $750 [README.md]. | "Just last month, on September 7, a vendor and I agreed on seven hundred dollars a month for point-of-sale hardware. The written quote said seven hundred fifty. I caught the difference and he corrected it. I built Second Seat for myself first. The idea predates this hackathon. This week's build is the live engine." |
| 0:25–0:40 | `/session?demo=1`. "Offline demo" label (`#offline-label`) stays visible. Paste the full unchanged `demo/synthetic-transcript.txt` into `#transcript-input`. Click `#btn-redact`. State reads "Review required". | "I paste that made-up call in. This is an offline demo." |
| 0:40–0:50 | Preview: full names and `555-013-8844` are masked. Bare `Amira` is still visible. `ellis.ward@northglass-retail.example` is still visible. Do not correct them yet. Do not credit this preview to a model. | "The phone and the full names are masked. Bare Amira and the email are still visible." |
| 0:50–1:08 | Click `#btn-approve` while the email is still in the preview. Click `#btn-analyze`. State returns to "Review required — check the redacted preview, then approve." No findings appear. Unspoken note, not a caption: historical evidence for a different meeting remains Playwright test [apps/web/e2e/d2-approval.spec.ts](../../apps/web/e2e/d2-approval.spec.ts) test "D2-6" (full paste-to-copy flow with exact clipboard bytes, fake transport); scripted walkthrough in [apps/web/proof/d6-public-demo-session.md](../../apps/web/proof/d6-public-demo-session.md) (screen video pending a human recording). Do not say this paste shows "last chance" or a fifty-dollar gap. | "This Analyze attempt was blocked before downstream analysis." |
| 1:08–1:30 | Select the email and type `[REDACTED_email]`. Select bare `Amira` and type `[REDACTED_person]`. Click `#btn-approve`. State reads "Approved." Click `#btn-analyze`. Wait until the state reads "Completed." | "I replace the email and the bare first name, then I approve this exact text." |
| 1:30–1:48 | Two findings, each with a citation that resolves on this page. Click one of those citations. No pressure item. Heading reads "Needs owner review" and says claim support was not checked. Do not say the screen caught a fifty-dollar gap or a November 15 badge. | "Only the text I approved gets analyzed. I see two findings and no pressure item. The heading says the claim check did not run." |
| 1:48–1:56 | This transcript shows no `.pressure-review` checkbox. Do not tick or click a checkbox that is not on screen. | "There is nothing to check here. Copy is not waiting on a pressure box for this meeting." |
| 1:56–2:24 | In `#draft-text`, type: "Please send a corrected written quote. I have not accepted the deadline." `#btn-copy` stays disabled until approval. Click `#btn-draft-approve` with an explicit click. `#btn-copy` enables. Click `#btn-copy` once. Then change one word. `#btn-copy` disables. | "I write the reply, I approve that exact text, and I copy it once. I change one word and Copy turns off. Second Seat never sends a reply or message to the vendor." |
| 2:24–2:34 | One card, already on screen, for at most ten seconds. Unspoken file cites, not generated by this take: support 9/9 seeded errors and 0/4 false alarms [eval/results/support-table.md]; rules 71/71 seeded mutants blocked or escalated and 0/13 semantic gaps caught [eval/results/rules-table.md]. | "Small samples, not from this take. Nine of nine seeded errors, zero of four false alarms. Seventy-one of seventy-one mutants blocked, zero of thirteen gaps caught." |
| 2:34–2:45 | Logo. | "A human in the final seat." |

## Unspoken notes (not captions)

- The blocked Analyze is one refused request. Do not say that nothing was ever sent, or that raw text never left a server. In a future live take, raw text would already have reached the redactor before this check. That live take is NOT YET AUTHORIZED / NOT YET RECORDED. It would replace time inside this plan. It does not add time, and this script has no deploy or warmup steps.
- The Oct 28 owner-attested run summary stays with commit `0365fdb` and that run's own input. It is not this synthetic transcript and not an independently checked clip.
- Superseded wording (no longer claimed): "any edit to the draft or transcript clears the approval" — replaced by the open-page plus reload-caveat narration above (F4 partly open).
- Show only the connected `/session` paste-to-copy flow. No screenshot upload and no SAM in this video.
- User observations and video URLs stay PENDING. Windows checks stay PENDING.
