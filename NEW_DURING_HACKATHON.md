# New during the hackathon (Oct 26–Nov 4, 2026)

Daily log of work added in this repo. Everything below was built this week;
the earlier Second Seat idea and prototype live elsewhere and are not included.

## Oct 28 — Phase 04b shield report

- `eval/shield-report.mjs` prints pattern, spark, gate, and combined shield N/M with Wilson 95% intervals on the public dev fixtures, plus a mutation check. `--split heldout` is accepted and refused before any held-out file is opened.

## Oct 26 — Phase 01: Repo bootstrap

- Workspace scaffold: root `package.json` (private, pnpm 9), `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, strict `tsconfig.base.json`.
- `packages/core` with transcript types and the outgoing safeguard (`screenOutgoing`, `classifyIncoming`), zero runtime dependencies.
- `services/bot` stub (fixture model client) and `apps/web` stub (hero heading).
- Tests: `outgoing.test.ts`, `core-deps.test.ts`, plus stub tests.
- CI with typecheck, tests, and a secret scan; README, `.env.example`, license pending note.
Truth seal proof: seal commit 3690746 (2026-10-26 12:14:14 -05:00), made before any model run, in squash-merged PR #2 https://github.com/Bridgett50/second-seat-hackathon/pull/2 (main 8abe1d1); SHA256SUMS sha256 at seal 1e68350f2b4a3b50cd1fc7dff67b52ee5eaf7ace3d66247dc0085faaf67b3614.
- Phase 03a: deterministic brief validators (`validateBrief` in `packages/core/src/evidence/validate.ts` plus `test/evidence-regressions.test.ts`).

## Oct 28 — Clean UI rebuild + AI Twin stage

- Web UI design rebuilt fresh this week, inspired by the earlier prototype's look (soft purple/pink palette, rounded soft-shadow cards, pill badges, header bar). No code from the earlier prototype was copied; the theme is new plain CSS in `apps/web/src/theme.ts`.
- "AI Twin of Bridgett" stage panel beside the brief on `/session` and `/briefs/demo`, with a visible "AI-generated" label. It loads `apps/web/public/ai-self.png` (or `.jpg`) when present and otherwise shows a pastel "BS" initials placeholder.
- `apps/web/public/ai-self.png`: AI-generated image created Oct 28, 2026 by Bridgett with Pika AI Self (her own likeness). Only the image is used; no Pika UI elements.
- Demo Mode switch, both approval gates, and the loading states are unchanged in behavior. Tests: `apps/web/test/clean-ui.test.ts`, `apps/web/e2e/clean-ui.spec.ts`.
