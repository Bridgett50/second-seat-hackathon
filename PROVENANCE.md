The tests live in services/bot because they run the room against the real
frozen connector, and core cannot import the bot. Two UI/holo-only cases moved
to session B: T17-6 (reads the web meeting-room page) and T18-6 (reads the holo
demo script and README). F2-9 removed in port: asserted holo mirror-connector id
generation; frozen services/bot/src/meeting/connector.ts uses node:crypto.

Not ported:
- holo `t2/connector.ts` (a mirror of this repo's connector)
- `t2-connector-mirror.test.ts` (tests that mirror)
- `t2-connector-suite.test.ts` (this repo's `services/bot/test/meeting-connector.test.ts` covers the real connector)
- the web UI and Playwright (session B)

## New in this repo (Muse Code, this PR; no holo source)

- packages/core/src/t2/connector-port.ts: the connector port type and
  `packageHash`. `@second-seat/bot` depends on core, and core's dependency
  guard allows only relative/`node:` imports, so the twin room takes an
  injected connector factory instead of importing the bot.
- services/bot/src/t2-room.ts: wires the frozen
  `services/bot/src/meeting/connector.ts` into the room. The connector file is unchanged.
- packages/core/test/t2-port.test.ts, services/bot/test/t2-port-wiring.test.ts.

### Review fix B-1 (Oct 29, 2026)

`act()` in apps/web/src/meetingRoom.ts now enforces input caps before calling
any room method: at most 2,000 characters of guide text, 20,000 characters of
edit-draft or compare text (over a length cap returns 413 with the room
unchanged), and at most 50 guidance entries per meeting (the 51st returns
400). Only `text.length` is checked; over-limit text is never scanned or
redacted. `packages/core/src/t2/redaction.ts` `EMAIL_PATTERN` was bounded
(local part 1-64, domain 1-253, TLD 2-24) to stop quadratic backtracking on
long non-email input; core behavior on normal emails is unchanged.

### Review fix B-4 (Oct 29, 2026)

A refused Send now renders its reason in `#send-notice` (role="alert") next to the Send
button (snapshot field `sendNotice`). Written by Muse Code on meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026
via Baseten (owner-approved after the Meta credits ran out).

### Review fix B-5 (Oct 29, 2026)

The meeting room import guard (apps/web/test/meeting-room-imports.test.ts) now also catches star
re-exports, require/createRequire, path specifiers into packages/core or node_modules/@second-seat/core,
and destructured, bracket or non-literal dynamic imports, and scans .mts/.cts/.cjs/.jsx too.
Written by Muse Code on meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026 via Baseten.

### Review fix B-6 (Oct 29, 2026)

The meeting room page now always shows a "Run plugins" button (`#run-plugins`, disabled once plugins
cannot run: after takeover or once the package leaves "unsent"), so plugins run outside the guided
demo. Written by Muse Code on meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026 via Baseten.

### Review fix B-7 (Oct 29, 2026)

The `mr_store` cookie now carries `Secure` except for plain-http loopback requests
(`meetingRoomSetCookie` in apps/web/src/meetingRoom.ts). Written by Muse Code on
meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026 via Baseten.

### Review fix R2-1 and owner decision MR-G7 (Oct 29, 2026)

Bridgett confirmed MR-G7 as an owner decision (Oct 29, 4:55 PM CT): approval stays on a
same-browser reopen while the server keeps the room. The restored-room line now says so
("draft, send state and approval stay while this server keeps the room") instead of claiming
approval never survives. Written by Muse Code on meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026 via Baseten.

### Review fix R2-3 (Oct 29, 2026)

A `?demo=1` page now always starts on its own fresh, unshared room and store, so the guided demo
never opens on (or writes into) the cookie's real room. Written by Muse Code on
meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026 via Baseten.

### Review fixes B-3 and R2-2 (Oct 29, 2026)

B-3 (a room flood no longer evicts other browsers' rooms: store keys capped at 200 with idle
eviction, `MeetingRoomBusyError`/503, a per-key page cap) was written by Muse Code on muse-spark-1.3
via Meta (session 4bc40127-5104-475d-bb0f-467c792ebdcb); its test typing fix was written by Muse Code
on meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026 via Baseten (session f298034a-3dd6-4959-95af-7e1f0e87b23f).
R2-2 (an evicted key's stale tabs; test MR-F6) was written by Muse Code on
meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026 via Baseten (session dd908779-fcbd-4c36-9847-94d7d8bdbf49).

### Review fix N-1 (Oct 29, 2026)

Store keys that never acted (open only) are now evicted first, least recently opened, so a flood
of plain GETs no longer locks new visitors out; keys that acted are evicted only after 30 idle
minutes, and 503 is returned only when every key acted recently. Written by Muse Code on
meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026 via Baseten.

### Review follow-up to N-1 (Oct 29, 2026)

Only successful state-changing actions (stream-next, guide, select-meeting, edit-draft, approve,
takeover, run-plugins, plugin-*, send, demo-next, demo-restart) mark a store key as acted; GET
opens, `state`, `evidence-export` and refused actions do not (tests MR-A1, MR-A2). An action on an
evicted room now answers 404 with "This room expired. Reload to start again." (test MR-A3).
Written by Muse Code on meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026 via Baseten.

Note: N-1 commit cbe1f21 was run and pushed by hand by Opus on the bot computer at Bridgett's request because the Auto-review safety check was erroring; the code was written by Muse Code.

### Review fixes N-2 and N-3 (Oct 29, 2026)

Demo (?demo=1) pages are capped at 200 globally by evicting the oldest demo page, record no
activity for their key, never mark a key as acted, and no longer count against a key's 20-page
cap (tests MR-DC1, MR-DC2 in apps/web/test/meeting-room-demo-cap.test.ts).
Written by Muse Code on Baseten (meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026).

### Busy page points to the guided demo; limitation L-1 (Oct 29, 2026)

The 503 busy page now reads "Meeting room is busy. Try again later, or open the guided demo at
/meeting-room?demo=1." (test MR-F5), and README "Known limitations" documents L-1: an acting flood
can fill all 200 rooms for up to 30 minutes while the guided demo keeps working.
Written by Muse Code on Baseten (meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026).

### Meeting room actions bound to the browser that opened the room (Oct 29, 2026)

Every POST /api/meeting-room action now checks that the request's own mr_store cookie is the key
that opened the room; another browser's cookie or no cookie gets 404 with no snapshot, across all
action branches including the guided demo (test F140-1a). The cookie Path is now "/" so the browser
sends it to /api/meeting-room; same-cookie tabs share a room and the demo stays isolated (test
F140-1b, real Chrome cookie jar). The test file apps/web/test/meeting-room-browser-binding.test.ts
was written by the runner/executor (Grok Bot) as test scaffolding and copied in by Muse Code with a
single cp; the exact source edits were specified in the task prompt by Grok Bot from a Codex review
finding and applied by Muse Code on Baseten (meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026).

### Approve and Send bound to the displayed package (Oct 29, 2026)

The meeting room snapshot now carries a server-derived packageId (selected meeting id plus the
sha256 of the complete composed package), rendered on the Approve and Send buttons. POST
/api/meeting-room accepts the new packageId field; Approve and Send without a valid identity get
400 and a stale or forged identity gets 409, before the room is touched (tests F140-2a, F140-2b).
The page discards obsolete responses and an unsaved editor change immediately disables Approve,
Send and export and clears the copy/mailto affordances until the edit is saved (test F140-2c).
Both the source edits and the test file apps/web/test/meeting-room-approve-displayed.test.ts were
written by Muse Code on Baseten (meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026), in small edits from exact
contents that Grok Bot specified in the task prompt from a Codex review finding.

### Unsaved package edits survive unrelated responses (Oct 30, 2026)

A Codex recheck of #142 found that any response carrying page HTML (for example Compare) replaced
the page and cleared the unsaved-edit state, so an unsaved correction was discarded and Approve,
Send and export were enabled again for the previously approved text. Now only a successful Save of
the package clears the unsaved state; any other response keeps the editor text and keeps Approve,
Send and export disabled with the copy/mailto affordances cleared. Test F140-2d: approve A, type
unsaved B, Compare, then the editor still shows B, outgoing controls stay disabled and no outgoing
request or fake transport call happens; after Save B and an explicit Approve, exactly one fake
Send carries exactly B. F140-2d failed on aa8f7d9 and passes on this head; F140-2c is unchanged.
The renderer change and the test were written by Muse Code on Baseten
(meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026) from exact contents that Grok Bot specified in the task
prompts, one small part per short Muse session, each committed separately.

### Follow-up: Muse Code rewrote the F140-1 test file (Oct 29, 2026)

The entry "Meeting room actions bound to the browser that opened the room" above records that
apps/web/test/meeting-room-browser-binding.test.ts was first written by
the runner/executor (Grok Bot) as test scaffolding and copied in by Muse Code. In this follow-up
commit Muse Code on Baseten (meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026) deleted that file and wrote it again
itself, in small edits from exact contents Grok Bot specified in the task prompt. The test names
and assertions are unchanged; the only additions are "end of F140-1 test part N" marker comments
that anchored the edits. Original test contents by Grok Bot; Muse Code re-applied them unchanged
with marker comments through Baseten. F140-1a and F140-1b were
re-verified red on d217380 and green on the F140-1 head.

### Package editor edits the owner-written base (Oct 29, 2026)

The meeting room package editor used to hold the full composed package (owner text plus every
included plugin section) while Save stored that text as the editable base, so each unchanged Save
appended the included sections again (799 to 1180 characters in the synthetic fixture) and Exclude
could no longer remove them. The twin room view now exposes draft.base (the owner-editable text
without the managed plugin sections) next to draft.body (the full composed package that is hashed,
approved and sent). The editor renders draft.base; the preview still shows the full draft.body;
Include/Exclude alone manage plugin sections, and no owner-written text is ever deleted by
matching. A real change to an approved package still clears approval (tests F140-3a, F140-3b).
Both the source edits and the test file apps/web/test/meeting-room-editable-base.test.ts were
written by Muse Code on Baseten (meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026), in small edits from exact
contents that Grok Bot specified in the task prompts from a Codex review finding. Because the
provider stream kept failing with protocol errors on one long session, the work was split into
several short sequential Muse sessions, each committed separately on muse/f140-3-editable-base.

### Guided compare and evidence steps show and keep their results (Oct 30, 2026)

Guided steps 7 (compare) and 8 (evidence) used to drop their outputs: the demo-next response
carried only the snapshot and announcements, and every response re-rendered the page empty. The
demo-next response now returns the step-7 comparison and step-8 evidence JSON in the same fields
the Compare and Export actions use, the snapshot keeps both until Restart, and the server render
fills #compare-result and #evidence-json from it, so they stay visible after takeover. On a public
demo the evidence shows the approved package hash and the unsent state, with no send receipt
(tests F140-4c service and browser). The test cases and the source edits in apps/web/src/meetingRoom.ts
and apps/web/src/meetingRoomRender.ts were written by Muse Code on Baseten
(meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026), in small edits from exact contents that Grok Bot specified in the
task prompts from a Codex recheck finding, split into ten short sequential Muse sessions, each
committed separately on muse/f140-4-public-guide.

### Bundled-Chromium fallback for the import-privacy test and the Playwright config (Oct 30, 2026)

apps/web/test/meeting-room-import-privacy.test.ts and apps/web/playwright.meeting-room.config.ts
now launch system Chrome when PLAYWRIGHT_CHROME_PATH is set or /usr/bin/google-chrome exists, and
otherwise Playwright's bundled Chromium, matching the four browser test files changed on
muse/f140-4-public-guide. The edits and this entry were written by Muse Code on Baseten
(meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026), in small edits from exact contents that Grok Bot specified in
the task prompt, in short sequential Muse sessions on muse/f140-5-import-privacy (the first two stopped
on provider errors; each next session continued from the remaining steps).

### Demo reset and Restart tests, browser fallback, announcement period (Oct 30, 2026)

Follow-ups on muse/f140-4-public-guide. services/bot/test/t2-demo-mode.test.ts T13-10 holds a slow
step 1, queues a second next(), calls reset(), and checks the queued call is dropped and step 1
then runs once (guard; it fails if the queued call ignores the demo generation).
apps/web/test/meeting-room-demo-guide.test.ts adds a test-mode case where a Next held inside the
old demo across Restart answers with the fresh room at 0 of 9 (regression). The four meeting-room
browser test files launch system Chrome when PLAYWRIGHT_CHROME_PATH is set or
/usr/bin/google-chrome exists, and otherwise Playwright's bundled Chromium; README.md notes this.
demoStepAnnouncement in packages/core/src/t2/a11y.ts adds a final period only when the caption
lacks one (every caption already ended with one, so announcements read "..");
services/bot/test/t2-a11y.test.ts T17-7 covers it (regression). The source edits, tests, README
line and this entry were written by Muse Code on Baseten (meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026), in
small edits from exact contents that Grok Bot specified in the task prompts, split into six short
sequential Muse sessions, each committed separately on muse/f140-4-public-guide.

### Overlapping guided-demo Next calls cannot bypass or duplicate Send (Oct 30, 2026)

The meeting room's demo-next handler in apps/web/src/meetingRoom.ts checked "is the current step
Send, and is sending allowed?" before queueing its call, so an overlapping Next could see a stale
step. With two service-level calls issued together (Promise.all on the service, not a confirmed
browser double-click; paired HTTP requests already advanced correctly), a public demo attempted
Send instead of recording it as not sent. The demo controller in packages/core/src/t2/demo-mode.ts
now has nextUnless(), which evaluates the skip check inside the queued call against the step that
is current when the call runs, and demo-next uses it. Restart now resets the old controller before
replacing the room, so a Next still queued on the old demo is dropped instead of running Send on
the replaced room, and a call that waited across a Restart reports the fresh room. Tests in
apps/web/test/meeting-room-demo-guide.test.ts: the public overlapping case (regression), test mode
sends exactly once (guard), the same overlap over the real HTTP route (guard), and Restart with
queued Next calls sends nothing and leaves a fresh room (regression). The source edits and tests
were written by Muse Code on Baseten (meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026), in small edits from exact
contents that Grok Bot specified in the task prompts from a Codex finding, split into nine short
sequential Muse sessions, each committed separately on muse/f140-4-public-guide.

### Guided demo skip and reset act in order with pending Next calls (Oct 30, 2026)

After next() was serialized, skip() and reset() in packages/core/src/t2/demo-mode.ts still acted
immediately, so a skip() issued while a next() was in flight skipped the wrong step, and a reset()
during a pending next() let the stale step count after the restart. skip() now waits behind any
in-flight calls and returns a Promise (the meeting room's Send-step handler in
apps/web/src/meetingRoom.ts awaits it), and reset() takes effect at once and cancels calls issued
before it, so their results are discarded (tests T13-8: next() and skip() together run step 1 and
skip step 2; T13-9: after reset() nothing stale counts and the next call runs step 1 once). The
source edits and tests T13-8 and T13-9 in services/bot/test/t2-demo-mode.test.ts were written by
Muse Code on Baseten (meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026), in small edits from exact contents that
Grok Bot specified in the task prompts from a Codex recheck finding, split into four short
sequential Muse sessions, each committed separately on muse/f140-4-public-guide.

### Overlapping guided-demo Next calls advance one step each (Oct 30, 2026)

The guided demo controller's next() in packages/core/src/t2/demo-mode.ts read the step at the
current position, awaited it, and only then advanced, so two overlapping calls (a double click or
two Next requests) both ran step 1 and the guide step never ran. Each next() call now waits for
the previous one, so calls run one at a time in call order and each advances exactly one step
(test T13-7: two concurrent calls return steps 1 and 2, two steps completed, the guide ran once).
The source edit and test T13-7 in services/bot/test/t2-demo-mode.test.ts were written by Muse Code
on Baseten (meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026), in small edits from exact contents that Grok Bot
specified in the task prompts from a Codex recheck finding, split into three short sequential Muse
sessions, each committed separately on muse/f140-4-public-guide.

### Public guided demo no longer stalls at Send; Restart gives a fresh demo room (Oct 29, 2026)

On a public demo (test mode absent or 0) the guided demo used to return 403 at the Send step
forever (completed 5 of 9), and Restart only reset the captions while the room kept its approved,
sent and paused state. Next now records the Send step as not attempted, shows a visible "not sent"
note (no package is marked sent and no send receipt exists), and continues through comparison,
evidence and takeover against the actual approved, unsent package; a direct Send stays 403.
Restart now replaces the demo page's room, in-memory store and guide controller with fresh ones
under the same page id, browser key and demo-cap slot, so a test-mode rerun sends exactly once
more through the fake transport; ordinary rooms are never touched (tests F140-4a, F140-4b). The
demo controller gained skip() for a not-permitted step. The existing MR-R4 render test was updated
to the required behavior (200 and progression to step 6 instead of 403) and keeps its safety
checks: the send-disabled reason is announced, zero fake sends, and the package is not sent.
The source edits, the MR-R4 update and the new test apps/web/test/meeting-room-demo-guide.test.ts
were written by Muse Code on Baseten (meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026), in small edits from exact
contents that Grok Bot specified in the task prompts from a Codex review finding, split into
several short sequential Muse sessions, each committed separately on muse/f140-4-public-guide.
### Import panel states where imported text goes (Oct 29, 2026)

The meeting room's import panel said "Nothing leaves the browser", but Compare posts the imported
text to this app's own server (POST /api/meeting-room). The panel now says, before the import box
and Compare: "Compare sends this text to this app's server; this demo does not call an external
model or send email." Only the wording changed; network behavior is unchanged. Test F140-5a checks
the rendered panel (it failed on the parent e06a76a because of the old claim). Test F140-5b is a
control that already passed before the wording fix: in a real browser on a private loopback server
with the test-mode network guard on, Compare posts the exact synthetic marker in its text field to
the local /api/meeting-room, every browser request stays on the loopback origin, the server guard
records no outside call or analyzer call, and the fake email transport is not called.
The wording change and the new test apps/web/test/meeting-room-import-privacy.test.ts were written
by Muse Code on Baseten (meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026) from exact contents that Grok Bot
specified in the task prompts from a Codex review finding, one small part per short sequential
Muse session, each committed separately on muse/f140-5-import-privacy (test parts first, then the
source edit).

### README founder story attribution (Oct 30, 2026)

The "## Founder story" section at the top of README.md is Bridgett Sanders's wording: she supplied
and approved it. Muse Code on Baseten (meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026) made the README edits from
task prompts that Grok Bot wrote: it added the section in 25fc903 and, at her direction, changed one
phrase in a818711 ("my real email thread" to "an imported email draft"). In 5a16c7c Muse Code also
reworded the README intro sentence below the section so it says the app sends no real email and
joins no real calls.

### README and PROVENANCE accuracy corrections (Oct 30, 2026)

README.md now says that Glimmer redaction applies when Live mode is separately configured, while
Offline mode uses local code and calls no model; that the meeting room twin is a scripted demo on
synthetic data whose Send goes only to a fake transport; how the meeting-room Playwright suite picks
a browser (PLAYWRIGHT_CHROME_PATH, else /usr/bin/google-chrome if it exists, else Playwright's
bundled Chromium); and how Muse Code's coding role differs from the runtime Meta models. PROVENANCE.md
adds the founder-story attribution above and count-free session wording in the Chrome fallback
entry. Bridgett Sanders requested these corrections, Grok Bot wrote the task prompts with the exact
text, and Muse Code on Baseten (meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026) made the edits in short sequential
sessions on muse/f140-5-docs-accuracy; some sessions stopped on provider errors and the next session
continued from the remaining steps.

### Render runtime builder and bootstrap bound (Oct 30, 2026)
Muse Code on Baseten, model `meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026`, wrote the builder, its synthetic tests and the bounded-decompression fix in a source-only, no-tools session (session `70651af8`) from a requirements-only task written by Grok Bot for Bridgett Sanders; Grok Bot applied the returned output verbatim. It continued an earlier bootstrap session that stopped on a provider error. An earlier attempt with the undated model id `meta-models/muse-spark-open` failed with HTTP 403 before producing anything. This correction session (same model and settings) tightened the dependency-link checks and fixed the tests. No deploy or production result is claimed.
